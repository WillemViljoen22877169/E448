\hline
\textbf{ECSA Outcome} & \textbf{Ch.} & \textbf{Motivation} \\
\hline
ELO 1. Problem solving: Identify, formulate, analyse and solve complex engineering problems creatively and innovatively. & 1, 3, 4, 5 & Chapters 1 and 3 introduce and conceptualize the problem, Chapter 4 details the design process, and Chapter 5 discusses problem resolution through system evaluation. \\
\hline
ELO 2. Application of scientific and engineering knowledge: Apply knowledge of mathematics, natural sciences, engineering fundamentals and an engineering specialty to solve complex engineering problems. & All & Every chapter contributes to applying scientific and engineering knowledge to develop and refine the BMS. \\
\hline
ELO 3. Engineering Design: Perform creative, procedural and nonprocedural design and synthesis of components, systems, engineering works, products or processes. & 3, 4 & Chapter 3 sets the design requirements, while Chapter 4 provides an in-depth look at the creative and procedural design process. \\
\hline
ELO 4. Investigations, experiments and data analysis: Demonstrate competence to design and conduct investigations and experiments. & 5 & Chapter 5 is dedicated to the evaluation of the system, which includes conducting experiments and analyzing data. \\
\hline
ELO 5. Engineering methods, skills and tools, including Information Technology: Demonstrate competence to use appropriate engineering methods, skills and tools, including those based on information technology. & All & The integration of engineering methods, skills, and IT tools is evident throughout the report. \\
\hline
ELO 6. Professional and technical communication: Demonstrate competence to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with engineering audiences and the community at large. & 6 & The conclusion chapter demonstrates the ability to communicate the project's findings and implications effectively. \\
\hline
ELO 8. Individual work: Demonstrate competence to work effectively as an individual. & All & The report, as a whole, is indicative of the author's ability to work independently on a complex engineering project. \\
\hline
ELO 9. Independent Learning Ability: Demonstrate competence to engage in independent learning through well-developed learning skills. & All & The successful completion of the report showcases the author's independent learning abilities throughout the project. \\
