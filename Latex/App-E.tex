    {\tiny Special thanks:\newline
    \textcolor{gray}{I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to my Lord and my family for their unwavering support throughout my undergraduate studies. All my success and all my failures belongs to the Lord who gives me strength, thank You for Your grace upon my life. I am particularly grateful to my father for believing in me and funding my undergrad studies, which gave me the opportunity to pursue my dreams. My mother's constant encouragement and support have been invaluable. I would also like to thank my partner for helping me overcome the challenges that I faced during my studies and for having faith in me every step of the way. To everyone who was apart of this 5 year journey of mine, your support has been instrumental in helping me achieve my goals and for that I am grateful.}}
