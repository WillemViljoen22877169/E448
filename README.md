# E448

BMS Skripsie:

A modular battery management system for LFP batteries.

Description:

This project entails the develop of a battery management system (BMS) for Lithium Iron Phospate batteries (LFP) that is modular and therefore easily scalable in nature.
The aim is to develop individual balancing boards for each cell level and to in- tegrate them to successfully manage each cell and the entire battery.
So, the scope will be to develop four balancing boards for a 12V LFP battery, as well as a main supervisory board to coordinate the balancing boards and to communicate with the outside world.

Installation:

Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/WillemViljoen22877169/E448.git

Usage:

The aim of the project is to complete the development of a printed circuit board (PCB) with two accessible parts, namely an Arduino code file for the Beetle DFRobot program and a KiCad file for hardware development.
